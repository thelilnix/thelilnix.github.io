      <description>It was about two months ago (November 2021) I was invited to a private program. According to their program scope, I decided to hack them for a while. This post is about a vulnerability I’ve found in this company that led to RCE.
Reconnaissance In this step, my recon methodology was not finding some unique subdomains or assets. I was searching for some web applications with some interesting features such as login or file upload.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m LIL NIX x_x ! A hacker (actually a bug hunter),
I started programming since 2016 and hacking since 2019 (??).
I usually listen to Eminem, 2pac and other rap legends.
LIL NIX loves web and blockchain hacking a lot.
No matter what do you think about me, LIL NIX doesn&amp;rsquo;t give a fuck.
Think out of ▢ !</description>
